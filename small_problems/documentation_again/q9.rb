# Down the Rabbit Hole

# In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a 
# program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with 
# YAML::load_file:. Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.


# According to a quick Google search, "the YAML module is an alias for Psych".
# Ruby documentation includes a ::load_file method for the Psych class.
