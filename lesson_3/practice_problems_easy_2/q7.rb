# Add Dino and Hoppy to the array this time.

flitnstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy")

# While the shovel operator only accepts one argument, explicitly calling the
# #push method allows us to append multiple elements at once.


# Solution points out that we can also use #concat which takes one or more 
# arrays as arguments and appends each element of each supplied argument and
# appends to the original array.
