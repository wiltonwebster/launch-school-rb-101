title = "Flintstone Family Members"

# If we had a table of Flintstone family members that was forty characters in 
# width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

title.center(40)

# The center method takes a required integer argument for the width and an 
# optional argument for the padding character (space, by default).
